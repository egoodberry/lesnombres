Les Nombres
===========

Les Nombres is a very simple web application that I built
over a cup of coffee and a bagel; its sole purpose is to
help increase comprehension of spoken numbers in French.

The creepy robot voice is provided by a Javascript library
called [meSpeak](http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak), which was
kind enough to include a French language. So, really, the
hard part was done already.
